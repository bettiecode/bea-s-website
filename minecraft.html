                        I love building bridges. This build is only part of a bigger one, meant to be an adventure map, 
                        but I'll probably never finish it. I tried white, because I wanted to use the pale oak. I am so not used 
                        to having white blocks(that have stairs and other variants), that I am only realizing at the time of writing, 
                        I could have used pale oak trapdoors instead of iron ones.<br>
                        Inspired by fromsoft games, and Bdubs' Hermitcraft S10 nether hub.<br>

                        The world download of the SMP is lost, so I can't actually go back and take screenshots of
                        what it looked like on the server. But thankfully I was able to find it in my creative world, 
                        and place to into an all plains world, to mimic what it was like. It's probably the biggest thing I've 
                        ever built in survival. I mined all the blackstone myself, without shulker boxes and elytra btw. It felt amazing to show 
                        off my building skills to a whole a server, and a livestream audience.
                        I also designed the flying machine that works as a fromsoft elevator.<br>
                        It was inspired by Elden Ring's Divine Tower bridges, and how massive they look from 
                        below.<br>

                        It was my starter house, a project bit too big for that. But I managed to build it using only iron tools. 
                        It became a peaking point that could be seen from all across the server. And all of the server could be seen from 
                        the top of it. It was a beautiful symbol of our united creativity. It's not even a good build, but for this reason 
                        I am very proud of it. My dream of being able to show other people my passion for creation inside this game 
                        came true on this server. I am forever thankful to Uncheated for allowing it to happen.
