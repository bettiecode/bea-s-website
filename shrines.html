        I'm sorry Isaac.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another piece of music I was lucky to find out about through spotify autoplay. The Album has one 
        of the best vocals I've ever heard, and an outstanding choice of instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
        You know the album is peak when only one realationship was able to cause so many emotions that they were
        enough for a full tracklist.(Twin Fantasy) Isaac Wood sings about the pain he felt being treated like an ant 
        from up there.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is belongs among te other music that helps me cope with the fact that 
        Wilbur Soot was never who we saw in him through our love.
    </p>
    <h4>Songs</h4><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Intro:</b>
            <p>
            Instrumental. Cool instruments, a nice quick start to the journey.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Chaos Space Marine:</b>
            <p>
            The start hits hard. One of the best examples of how good the instruments are.
            I love his shaky voice, there's so much emotion inside it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably the happies song on here, 
                "So I'm leaving this body, and I'm never coming home again, yeah" 
                gives an uplifting feeling of freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
            He sings about his coping mechainsm, which is having a Warhammer 40k 
            hyperfixation. It's nice too see references I'm not too young to get. 
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Concorde:</b>
            <p>
            Named after the plane, this track introduces the allegory that gave the album its title.
            Isaac would climb up mountains, just see her light for a tiny milisecond, while all he would be from up there, 
            is an ant. This perfectly paints a picture of what the relation ship is like.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Die free this time" means that to be free would be to out of the relationship.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bread Song:</b>
            <p>
            Saddest song on the album. I don't have the entire genius interpretation memorized, but just by listening 
            again, I'm getting the feeling, that the song is about noticing the breadcrumbs, the scars her behaviour 
            is bleeding from. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Good Will Hunting:</b>
            <p>
                This song sounds like the self-awareness he feels about his one-sided unending love. He wishes 
                it wouldn't be one sided, he wouldn't be the dependent one, instead they could rely on one 
                another. Could, oh well.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Haldern:</b>
            <p>
                I cannot unhear that the beginning is referencing Minecraft, and he is digging holes to surivive
                the night, he finds escapes that are only temporary.
            </p>
            <p>
                He longs for her. She came into her life nad made everythig worth going through, so he's doing anything 
                to "stop your body leaving".
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Mark's theme:</b>
            <p>
            Instrumental tribute song for the late uncle of the saxophonist.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The Place Where He Inserted The Blade</b>
            <p>
                The song that made me fall in love with this band. The slow buildup alongside Isaac's shaky,
                emotional voice eminating such pain is just so fucking good. You son't need to understand the lyrics
                to know how helpless he feels.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It takes a few years, but they break bones" the constant pain lingering for long does things to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Isaac can't move on. Love, but even something simple as lunch he can't make without 
                thinking about her. He's inside a dream where everything is okay. "Good morning" but he gets woken up.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I like the biblical interpretation of the title. Like Thomas, Isaac needs see proof the be able to believe.
                He wants to believe. He wants to see his belief not being just a false dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You're not really sleeping." Only Isaac is inside that blissful slumber.
            </p>
            <p>
                Isaac would do anything for her, but there's nothing he can do to save the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Snow Globes:</b>
            <p>
                I can't really make sense of the Henry the 8th metaphors, but song feels like looking back at somebody else,
                at seeing that your situations aren't so different, and you are repeating their same mistakes. Because some 
                things are factual. Snow globes don't shake on their own. Henry knows, Isaac knows. But Isaac still has 
                a chance to shake it, to help himself, instead of waiting for things to set themselves into motion alone.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Basketball Shoes:</b>
            <p>
            The closing track, which does it's job, while also being as unforgettable as TPWHITB.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part shows him slowly but surely, being able to adjust and move on. He's feeling kinda 
                normal, things don't hurt that much now.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second part he's careless and happy again. It's nice to see the variety of emotion he can put into 
                his voice. The guitars support the sudden change in mood.
            </p>
            <p>
                The common interpretation for the third part is the wet dream he has of Charli xcx. But I like to interpret 
                it the other way. This part is addressed to us, the audience. Charlie symbolizes the giant amount of people 
                he never thought his songs would reach, and our "generous loan" doesn't help him gett better. His sheets getting wet 
                could indicate an emotion of fear.
            </p>
            <p>
                Isaac left the band shortly before the album's release. I really hope he's doing better.

    <p>
    The long awaited csh album. Ever since the first single, "Gethsemane"
    was dropped in early march, I could not wait until its release in early may.
    They did not disappoint. They released one of their best albums of all time. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The album is a rock opera, each song has its own story, which fits into the narrative 
    that encompasses the entire tracklist. Biblical themes, allegories appear often, while queer topics 
    appear just as often. Many different characters appear, who all go to an university 
    called Parnassus, hence the name "The Scholars". My favorite's are Perimones, Rosa  and the Accuser. 
    </p>
    <h4>Songs</h4><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>CCF (I'm Gonna Stay With You):</b>
            <p>
            Awesome intro, perfect for the opening track. I like Beolco, goat anthros are always cool.
            It was cool to learn what CCF means. It is nowhere near my top tracks form here, but that doesn't
            mean it isn't honorably good.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Deveraux:</b>
            <p>
            Their favorite &lt;3. The song's protagonist, Deveraux struggles to exist as a gay man while living
            in a conservative family. I can find him relatable. "they're turning animals to men" is one my 
            favorite lines, for it encaptures the murder of free and imaginitive human spirit by 
            capitalist society so beautifully. Also it can be interpreted as a play on sentences 
            commonly used in right-wing propaganda against furries and trans people, where they talk about 
            how leftist will turn your children into a homosexual or etc.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Lady Gay Approximately:</b>
            <p>
            Malory is a nice transgender allegory. The song is about him coming home expecting not 
            to be loved and accepted by his mom, but he experiences a happy disappointment. 
            "Am I dead? No you're my son." Just like Elon Musk did, many unaccepting parents see their trans kids 
            as dead. Malory too I can find relatable, because I too am trans.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The Catastrophe (Good Luck With That Man):</b>
            <p>
            Upbeat song about the fictional band's experiences touring the world. This would be to place 
            to bring up Artemis. He's the pink fox you can see on many of the official art. I don't know 
            enough about the lore to say more here, but the upbeat and happiness of this song nicely contrast 
            the upcoming track, "Reality".
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Equals:</b>
            <p>
            Perimones' song. He does something bad, and gets cancelled for it. He calls Beolco, for nobody 
            is willing to listen anymore. In the past, I have been both in a position that's similar 
            to both of theirs. The helplessness Perimones exprsses is beautiful. I can find his dialogue 
            relatable, but only after heavily misenterpreting it. 
            "What was the point of these hands, if they could give nothing but pain?" is a cool line regardless.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Gethsemane:</b>
            <p>
            The garden where they arrested Jesus. The song is very long, and I'm not even exactly sure what 
            it means. The song has multiple parts, which we transition through. Rosa and her "lizard-brain" 
            both appear. ROSA!!! Mouse anthros are also very cool, which kinda serves as a bias. She can heal 
            others by absorbing their pain, but she also absorbs their nightmares. I love this song as much 
            as I love all the other long, multi-part songs CSH wrote. Even though it's hard to make sense of it, 
            the entire 11 minutes are still a journey. Tabernacle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reality:</b>
            <p>
            Fucking awesome. The song is about Chanticleer's supposed death, and Artemis grieving him, 
            and it is told beautifully. 
            Starts slow, but grows louder just like the fox' emotions do. Amazing solo. Goldmine of awesome lines.<br> 
            "And I play back the tapes as often as I can, but we weren't meant to have memories this long." 
            (As the tapes "degrade into snowflakes" due to him playing them back over and over)<br>
            "You said you'd take me away on a starhsip, but baby why'd you have to wait so long?"<br>
            THE EARTH FELL OUT FROM UNDER ME
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Planet Desperation:</b>
            <p>
            My favorite song from CSH. I firmly believe the average song length of othet bands should be over 8 
            minutes aswell. The song is from Hyacinth, the dean's perspecitve, as he slowly accepts his impending 
            death, because Clown College raided Parnassus and poisoned him. We follow him along multiple thought 
            processes, as we transition through the parts of the song. The mood swings everywhere. I could talk 
            endlessly about how much I love this.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>True/False lover:</b>
            <p>
            The track is also among the favs, it is about the characters discovering theat Chanticleer is actually
            alive, and celebrating. I also love little voice recordings slippeed onto the end.
            Someone on reddit said this sounds like beating minecraft for the first time. I get where 
            he's coming from. If you are listening to the album in order from the beginning, then this track offers 
            a satisfactory, happy ending. Like everythig will be okay in the end. They will be.
            </p>

<p>
    I have been playing this game since 2016, meaning even after almost a decade, I still don't get 
    bored. This fact alone shows how amazing the game is.
</p>
<p>
    I don't have to tell you how significant Minecraft is, if you're here and you haven't heard about it 
    yet, then you are lying. A shrine is not enough to give it the tribute it deserves. 
</p>
<p>
    What you do in Minecraft is entirely up to you. It is diverse. Survival mode is just one of the many 
    different areas you can discover. The list doesn't end at pvp, building, redstone, parkour. 
    It never ends.
</p>
<b>building</b>
    <img 
        style="
            width: 20%;
            position: relative;

            border: none;
            " 
        src="shrines/minecraft/planks.png">
<p>
    My favorite. I decicated a whole subpage to it. I love experimenting with the new blocks 
    that are constantly being added. With WorldEdit, my imagination truly is the only limit. 
    Designing in creative and placing each block by hand in survival are different, but both 
    amazing experiences. The limitations force you to get creative(not the gamemode), you need 
    to find the block with right shape and color. Which is why vertical slabs should never be added. 
    Bdubs, and lots of other hermits are very inspiring to me.
</p>
<b>redstone</b>
    <img 
        style="
            width: 20%;
            position: relative;
            float: right;
            border: none;
            " 
        src="shrines/minecraft/redstone.png">
<p>
    I'm only partially invested in redstone. I don't know any of the more complicated stuff. I only like 
    designing doors and elevators for my builds.
</p>
<p>
    Redstone is like electrical wires in real life. They can do nothing more than be powered or not be powered. 
    But when combined together, things like computers come into exisctence. "mattbattwings" is the legend 
    of redstone computers.
</p>
<b>survival</b>
<p>
    Mining that first tree, exploring that first cave, digging that hole to trap cattle, planting that first seed, 
    building that first house is always refreshing. Even tough this starting phase doesnt last long compared to 
    the time you will spend on mega projects after you obtain the Elytra and shulker boxes. Philza and Hermitcraft 
    both show that people don't need creative mode to build things made up of tens of thousands of blocks. 
    Their dedication is enough. I can never stay with one world for too long, on Uncheated SMP S2 was most time I 
    gave to survival builds. I built the tree with iron tools, and the bridge ruins before going to the end. 
</p>
<p>
    I see so many people playing the game in a way that just disgusts me. Building the 23rd farm from a tutorial to 
    get a lot of items only to use them to build other farms(and they don't understand how they work), never actually 
    building anything beautiful. Just villager slave chambers, going completely against the will of the devs 
    who want you to be kind to the world around you. I like how they made slimeballs more easily obtainable, 
    I hope they will continue make the player less froced to build factories violating human rights. Altough 
    it will forever remain unavoidable for projects at the scale they have on Hermitcraft. 
</p>
<b>command blocks</b>
    <img

<p>
    It is an outdated topic in the age of datapacks, but I used to spend so much time making adventure maps, never 
    finishing a single one. I need to rewatch Csabusa's videos someday.
</p>
<b>mods</b>
<p>
    You should definetly try mods if you haven't done so yet. They enhance the experience greatly. They are 
    the main reason for the game reamianing entertaining even after this long, for they give a fresh experience 
    of learning how things work. I recommend: <i>Create, Biomes O' Plenty, Alex's mobs, Ice & Fire Dragons</i>

    I grew up on this game. Hungarian youtubers(DoggyAndi, ZsDav, IceBlueBird, JamesMC) and their old videos 
    will always have a special place in my heart. I want to load up 1.8 someday and try to relive my first time playing.

    The Dream SMP is the best (and worst) thing to have happened on the internet. You had to be there. 
    If you were, you know exactly what I am talking about. We got the most thrilling twist and heartbreaking 
    plotlines in the most random format. Minecraft Improvised Roleplay. All the fanart, all the fanfiction helped 
    make the silly gameplay become something worth missing other events for. (I was watching L'manberg blow up on
    2021/01/06.) 
</p>
<p> 
    The creators only laid the foundation of what the fandom built on. 
    Passerine was the main inspiration behind Blackbird. Moranth was inspired by c!Technoblade. Snowchester inspired Tahora, 
    L'manberg inspired the political lore in an abandoned project. The unique character design headcanons that 
    were born also inspired me, but I haven't even started that project yet.

    Technoblade never dies.

        The first part of the series is already a classic. I always find it wonderful, how amazing games 
        (Half-Life) Valve was able to makeback then, despite the hardware limitations. Even tough 2011 wasn't that long ago, and 
        Direct3D 9 isn't caveman technology, I can feel the same about Portal 2 a tiny bit. The game ran 
        flawlessly even on a prehistoric PC like mine. It's rare too see modern games, (especially 
        those developed in UE5) that don't run terribly in exchange for their high-tech hardware 
        accelerated rendering. But most likely, after some time passes, it will be UE5 games who will be 
        mourned through nostalgia.

        The sequel offers great puzzles, that were all fun to solve. Many new elements appear, which all combine 
        together to force you to think hard, and arrive at the euphoric and satisfactory solution. 
        Realizing that you have to transport the gel bubbles using the excursion funnel was truly a unique experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It was also cool to learn more about the lore, by exploring deepest depths of apeture science.

        My favorite thing of all about this game is the dialouge. Much like freeman, Chell also stays silent. 
        And the characters never address her by her name, just "you". This improves the immersion, as it 
        feels like the npcs are talking directly to you. I found what they are saying funny and entertaining. 
        GlaDOS roasting you will never get old. Her autotuned voice is iconic and wonderful. Wheatley is British. 
        Cave Johnson shares a VA with Omni-Man from Invincble, and he did an amazing perfromance as both roles.

        I sadly couldn't yet, but I am planning to 100% both games when I can.

            My favorite videogame of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I heard about ULTRAKILL first when I was talking about videogame OSTs with a friend. He recommended 
            me this game's soundtrack, and I immediately fell in love. After I perfected the demo, ULTRAKILL 
            became the first thing I used my credit card for, since I became old enough to have one near this time 
            too. At first it was just this cool shooter with cool robots and a biblical plotline. I had no idea, 
            how much more it would become. Pretty soon, the beautiful nihilstic journey through Dante's 
            Inferno unfolded before me.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I love this game enough to write an essay about each level. 
            At the time of writing, I just P-ranked P-1, and I am continuing on to P-rank all the 
            other sanctums, after P-ranking the main campaign on brutal difficulty.

                <b>OVERTURE: THE MOUTH OF HELL</b>
                <p>
                The prelude is unique to me, because I spent so much time in demo, waiting to be able to play 
                the full game. It used to be the ugliest layer, but the visual revamp improved its look a lot. 
                The soundtrack is cool, but it gets overshadowed by how much better it gets later on. I know an 
                amen break when I hear one.

                        <p>
                            This intro will never get old. The level nicely introduces the player to the most basic mechanics, 
                            and despite having only two(plus the boss) enemies, each room feels unique.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Filth are nothing on standard difficulty, but on brutal, they become a much bigger threat. 
                            They can still be just chainsawed through, if you pay attention to hard damage. Their design
                            is just as simple as the enemy is, a legs and a mouth, so it fits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Strays are the other enemy to appear on this level, to introduce the player to projectiles. 
                            They quickly become just a weak turret, although the speed of their bullets is insane on brutal, 
                            making it harder to parry, making them stronger.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Malicous Face, or as we like to call him: Maurice, is the first boss the player encounters. 
                            They are scary at first, especially their yellow attack. But they can actually be one-shotted. 
                            I discovered it by myself. Part of what makes this game good is how you make your own strategies. 
                            If you look back the old ULTRAKILL devlogs, then you can 
                            see how much the design has affected them. They remain a floating orb that shoots 
                            projectiles at you, but 
                            the design makes it feel like more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first weapon is found on this level, the Revolver. Your only reason to use it is because you 
                            haven't got the alternate Revolver yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Piercer(blue)'s is how a basic weapon should be, 
                            weak but relatively fast damage, and a stronger but much slower alt-fire. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Marksman(green) is the 
                            most unique and iconic weapon in ULTRAKILL. By itself it can't do much other than sniping enemies 
                            that move around a lot or are hiding somewhere. But it can be combined with other weapons to pull 
                            of complex techniques. Said manuevers are too hard for me to pull off tough.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Sharpshooter(red) is one of my favorites. If lined up correctly, it can deal insane damage, 
                            enough to one shot some big enemies. I'm not exactly sure how it works, and why shooting it at an 
                            enemy that is shooting at you makes a huge explosion like that, but it seems to do more than just 
                            launch bullets that ricochet.

                            The level is short if you go linearly, but there are many secret side ares, like the entrance to 0-S, 
                            and a secret bossfight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is the level where Swordsmachine appears. I can't put into words, how cool it is to see another entity 
                            going through the level parallel to you. I love their design a lot. It's asymmetrical, because they 
                            built themselves from scraps. They are easy to kill, since all their attack are parryable, and they can't 
                            move vertically. But it's still fun to fight them. One of my favorite enemies.

                        <p>
                            The first room got a lot prettier with the visual revamp. The update generally 
                            made all the levels on this layer look better by adding new lighting, it's most noticable here. 
                            Also they made it more circular, which looks good, even though Hakita had stated how time consuming it 
                            is to build round walls. They may have found a better to do it, since they appear more often since the revamp.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The new enemy on this level is the Schism. Its the only song I actually listen to from TOOL, but it's 
                            still nice to see the reference. I like their malformed design, but I play with PSX graphics so i cant really 
                            see all the details. They really aren't more than stronger Strays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Shotgun is the second weapon to be found. Being able to parry your own bullets and make them explosive 
                            was an accidental mechanic, but it's what makes ULTRAKILL's shotgun so amazing. It makes it useful both 
                            for close range, and encounters where enemies are grouped close together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Core Eject(blue) does what it's named after, and is great when you need a quick boom. You can also do tech 
                            with it: If you shoot the ejected core with the Malicous, then the explosions combine and make an even bigger 
                            one, which essential for the Flesh Prison bossfight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Pump Charge(green) also appears in my hand often. It can deliver an instant, high damage shot, 
                            but the explosion also damages you. I think you're meant to decide how much of your health you are willing 
                            to sacrifice for higher damage, but I just pump it to max everytime, since the blood of the enemies 
                            I kill with it will heal me back.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I definetly agree with the people who say that the Sawed-On(red) is overpowered. It can instantly kill 
                            close range enemies, like Filth. Easy way to heal quickly, but if you use it too much then hard damage 
                            will build up, and do the opposite. The hard damage buildup helps balance it a little. I still love this 
                            weapon, launching the chainsaw at the enemy and parrying it back as many times as i can is my number one 
                            method of quickly dealing large damage. I love Chainsaw-man, so I naturally find it cool to chainsaw through 
                            hellspawn.

                            The best level on this layer. I love the linearity of layout of the rooms, it feels so good 
                            to slide through it for the challenge. The cooling chambers are a nice addition, they remind us 
                            about the lore, that we are approaching the core of earth, on a path dug out by humans(perhaps).

                            Cerberus is the same as Maurice. They are tough the first time, but when you come back 
                            after fighting them as regular enemies, they are nothing. It is worth crediting though, that the small 
                            size of the arena makes them harder to defeat, than when you would see them in an open area. I don't 
                            really like their design, but I guess they were never meant to be more than just boring old stone statues. 
                            All the update did was give them abs.

                    I was surprised, when the doors opened before me, and I saw a meadow and a bright sky. This kind of 
                    hell portrayal was new to me at the time. Now I belive this to be superior over the boring flames and brimstone, 
                    for there so many things more painful than fire. I think this is where the revamp did best job, it is much more 
                    clearer, what is supposed to go on here. I couldn't recognize the walls as screens simulating the place sinners 
                    could be, but aren't, and so tortuting them. But now I can.

                        <p>
                            I talked about the surprise behind the level door in an earlier paragraph. The level nicely loops around, 
                            forcing the player to let the athmosphere in.

                            I don't hate an enemy more than the Drones. They are small, and move around unexpectedly, making them really 
                            hard to hit. They also launch at you and explode, complicating healing from them. But perhaps they were meant 
                            to be annoying. Also, the enemy roster definetly needs support units like them, instead of just the 100th iteration 
                            of the new highest priority target.

                            The third weapon is the Nailgun. It is the weapon with the most consistent dps, and is great against 
                            bosses, or other enemies with large health. The game improvises you to use it against them, since it is 
                            placed before a Maurice.

                            The Attractor(blue) can be effective if used correctly, but it's only useful really after 
                            obtaining the alternate Nailgun. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Overheat(green) is the variant that is the best and raising the dps. The best at the purpose of the 
                            Nailgun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Jumpstart(red) is also good, perhaps even better at the thing the Overheat is supposed to be best 
                            at, but it's a bit harder to pull of that extra damage at the end. It can also speed up trains, which is 
                            just a fun feature that makes it less forgettable.

                            Much like 0-2, this level also feels alive. Like you're not the only entity active. 
                            This communicates when you return to the first room to find it in flames that you didn't start.

                            I don't really like the first main room that much, since the enemies are in unreachable positions, 
                            and shooting them down from afar is difficult for someone with an aim like mine.

                            Streetcleaners are the first complexly designed enemy, both visually and mechanically. Unlike any enemy 
                            before, they don't just stand there and take your bullets, they dodge them. Their attacks are unparriable. 
                            They force you to come up with a different strategy, since explosions and parrying don't work against them, 
                            contrary to the other enemies up to this point. Wonderfully great enemy design is also something this 
                            game has, and this the first time it is shown off.

                            I also like their visual design. You can see that they are cleaners, but they also look like cool 
                            flamethrower-wielding robo-soliders. Machines all look cool in this game, except for the drone.

                            I don't have good relationship with this level, for it was the one I struggled most to P-rank. 
                            The level is much longer than any before, it works as a test of your strength before the bossfight. 
                            If you want to P-rank, then you need to go through both routes. I like to start with red, since it's 
                            harder in my opinion. I keep falling into lava in any level that has lava.

                            The Hideous Mass is the first challenging boss. Their attacks are big and strong, but luckily they can't move. 
                            You can also obliterate it with the soap. The fact that they only appear again in some of the hardest levels 
                            speaks for their strength. I find them ugly, but they should be since they're an abomination of hell mass overflow.

                            how I like to think about them: Two completely identical machines, only different in name and color. 
                            They hate each other deeply, and desperately believe that they are better than the other, because they 
                            were both programmed to have a god complex, because they are the same   .

                        <p>
                            My personal theory is: V1 has wings, it resembles an angel. He was made by God. God regrets making him, 
                            so He creates V2 to stop V1. I'd probably get made fun of on the lore discussion channel on discord, like 
                            I got the first and last time I tried to share my theories.

                            The alternate Revolver can be unlocked here. The fire rate decrease is worth the damage increase.

                            The storytelling starts to show in this level. You navigate through the electrical systems Minos used

                            most effective technique in ULTRAKILL, railcoining. If you shoot the enemy and the coins at the same time(by piercing through) 
                            then you can deal insane damage, although it is really hard to pull off.

                            The level immediately opens how the first ended. But this, time you are much stronger, and a 
                            Maurice means nothing to you anymore. The same thing happens in the room with three Cerberi. 
                            The bone staircase room had the biggest glowup since the revamp.

                            We meet Gabriel at last. He is voiced by the one and only Gianni. 
                            He delivers his beautifully written lines perfectly.

                            He's kinda the only character that actively speaks and takes part in the story. 
                            He actually goes trough character development. He starts off nice, gently warning the player, 
                            trying to avoid fighting. To him, this is just his job. He's the rightous hand of the father, who 
                            ensures the order. V1 is nothing to him but an object. He doesn't believe an object could defeat an angel 
                            like him. But that is what happens, and it changes him forever. It feels immersive, to have this impact on him.

                            Virtues are the second more complex enemy. Their design really builds on the idea of priority. If 
                            you don't kill them fast, they will get enraged, and they smite you even faster, from any distance. 
                            Visually, it's nice too see them be biblically accurate.

                            The difficulty has a sudden increase here. The level has two arena's full of enemies and a boss. Also, 
                            the sand mechanic is introduced, which the primary reason for this jump. Sand prevents you from healing, 
                            forcing you to be more careful. I also love how the Filth at the bginning just walk into the burning hot sand, 
                            perfectly showing the player what it does.

                            Stalkers show best how great the enemy design this. Instead of being 5672nd enemy that shoots at you, 
                            they help those that already do. They play a supportive role instead of an offensive one, making them unique.
                            It makes the enemies work together strategically.

                            We finally enter the pyramid. The darkness helps make the level feel unique. I love the 
                            symmetry of the final arena. That room is similar to 1-3, a final test of strength before the second

                            The rematch. V2 gets stronger, she now has more weapons. But you also got stronger, and she dies brutally.

                            A fun level overall. I like the layout of three rooms to go the final hardest one. The glowing

                            Before the sentries, nothing new is thrown at you, just all of the enemies you are used to at one place.
                            It checks if you have learned to use your tools yet.

                            Idols are like sand but much more effective at making an encounter harder. They completely mix up the 
                            priority of targets, and disallow the player to just kill the big enemy before it can attack. You are forced to 
                            keep dodging, and complete the room without dying. P-2 is the best example of how this can be deadly.

                            The Ferryman is also a forgettable boss. The fight is fun though, and the soundtrack is underrated.

                            In the intro, we already get surprised by the return of my fav, the Swordsmachine. I love the lighting

                            with "Altars of Apostasy".

                            I hate the Minotaur. He cuts your room to move even shorter than it already was, making the fight not so fun. 
                            It's kind of a shame, because everything else is perfect about the level. Other than the fight, the Minotaur plays 
                            a role similar to the Swordsmachine in 0-2. Their appearence foreshadows his fight which takes place in the depths below. 
                            They are the beast that lies below.

                            Mannequinns stand out with their visual design. I love how they are an amalgamation of limbs. Their movement is unique and irregular, which is what makes them 
                            feel different from the Stray, even though both of them are just low hp enemies that shoot at you.

                        <p>
                            The intro's theme's title "Do Robots Dream About Eternal Sleep?" asks an important question to the lore I like to think about.

                        <p>
                            This level has one of the best athmospheres. It feels like you are entering a warzone. Buildings collapse all around you. 
                            Hakita knew what he wanted the player to see after the door opens behind the Gutterman introduction. 
                            One of the coolest screenshots you can take.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Guttermen are the top of my list. They are intimidating, the highest priority enemies. Their lore and design only makes them better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Guttertanks don't get my appreciation that much. They are complicated for me. My playstlye relies on parrying, 
                            which is not effective against them.

                            The alternate Shotgun can be unlocked here. I love it. It's damage depends on your momentum, meaning you can 
                            use movement to prepare a gigantic blow.

                            Another beautiful looking level. "Suffering Leaves Suffering Leaves"'s title shows how dark the theme is. 
                            They successfully made the trees look uncanny and terrifying.

                            My favorite thing about this level is the infighting. It makes the enemies feel much more alive, 
                            and not like just a few lines of code. It helps with the same feeling I described in 0-2's paragraphs.

                            One of the prettiest levels. They nailed the athmosphere the city of Dis is supposed to have. Blood red darkness,

                            The level's soundtrack was made by Keygen Church. His use of organs gives it a holy sound, which fits into the

                            You have no idea, what you are getting yourself into, when you enter that door in 3-1, 
                            after P-ranking the first act. The ominous spine staircase leads you to the room of your misery.

                            Flesh Prison only stopped being menacing after I practiced the fight enough. It launches 
                            black holes, homing bullets, and virtue beams. Even if you manage to dodge those, while also doing
                            damage to it, if you didn't kill the eyes quick enough, it will just heal itself back instantly. 
                            The Core Eject+Malicous Railcannon combo is essential against it, because you can explode all the eyes at once, and after that, the 
                            boss becomes very easy. Just a large, motionless Octahedron that shoots slow, parryable projectiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you successfully take the prison down, Minos Prime is freed. He's fast and merciless. You have to 
                            concentrate on his behaviour, to predict how to dodge his next move. His attacks have a rythm you need to follow. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Minos may be strong and fast, but he's nothing compared to Gabriel on brutal difficulty. I still think 
                            that the Flesh Prison is actually more challenging. His design is simple enough to have an amogus effect
                            (you suddenly start see to see it everywhere if you look for it).

                            Even if you feel like you are prepared for anything after P-1, you will still be surprised. Instead of a bossfight, 
                            you need to go trough the hardest rooms ever, before you can even attempt to fight the boss stronger than Minos.

                        <p>
                            They went insane here. It literally starts with four Cerberi in a room smaller than 0-5's arena, and also there's a 
                            Virtue and a Ferryman. Idols keep the enemies you really need dead alive. The Idols are the main reason for the 
                            level's difficulty. Some boss enemies make a repeated appearance here and nowhere else, like the Ferryman and the Insurrectionist. 
                            I could talk endlessly about how well it combines everything to make the hardest level possible with stuff from acts I and II.

                            After the fake Flesh Panopticon fight, Sisyphus breaks out. He's tougher than Minos, but bigger 
                            and more often parryable. I think he looks ugly.

                            My favorite level gameplay-wise. You need to go through two long paths for two skulls, 
                            before the level even starts. Only after the title drop does the level show its true colors: 
                            The heat mechanic. It's like hard damage, but unavoidable.

                            Much like the encore level before, this one is also really fun to play. The room where the floor disappears 
                            introduces an element of difficulty not even P-2 did before. The final room especially, feels like P-2 but with more checkpoints.

            Yume Nikki is stands out with its strangeness. And how unique of an experinece the gameplay offers. 
            It's hard to convince people that pressing WASD for hours to walk through these "random" areas is worth trying,
            but I'm hoping my essay will give a little motivation to a curious reader.

            The game loop is simple. You go to sleep, explore the dream world, wake once you've reached a dead end, and repeat. However, 
            that exploration part is really intriguing. Nothing seems to make sense. No matter which door you continue through from the nexus, 
            you'll be surrounded by wierdness that you just cant wrap your head around at first. Much like how your dreams don't usually make sense. 
            We are in a dream. We are in the world Madotsuki's brain built based on her experiences, including her traumas. The deeper down you go, 
            the more darker things will get, for Madotsuki represses those traumatic memories. After 20 years, we can still only guess what it all means.

            I recommend playing with friends, and using the maps yume nikki online offers. 
            I linked their site instead of the steam page for a reason. You should start with the graffiti world and get the bike first.

            The story is amazing. It is about grief and memories. The beginning stars really emotional, really sad, only to be suddenly broken 
            by a seemingly random moment, of the hospital exploding. It seems wierd at first, but as you reach the ending, you understand why the main character 
            put it there. And it is so beautiful of a conclusion.
